The provided script downloads a minimal Ubuntu image, removes unneeded files, adds the provided Bash script, and builds a custom bootable ISO image. It then tests for the existence of a specified file, and if it exists, runs the script; if it doesn't exist, it opens a Bash session for the user.

To use this script, follow these steps:

    Open a terminal and create a new file, e.g., "build_iso.sh"
    Copy the script into the file and save it
    Make the file executable by running "chmod +x build_iso.sh"
    Customize the variables at the top of the script to fit your specific needs, such as ISO_NAME, MOUNT_DIR, ISO_DIR, SCRIPT_NAME, and FILEPATH
    Run the script by typing "./build_iso.sh" in the terminal

The resulting ISO image should be bootable and meet all the requirements specified. Note that the script installs xorriso package as a dependency, which is required for creating the ISO image.
